    ## 🎯 What This Demo Shows:
    
    ### The Trade-off:
    - **Low K (1-2)**: Fast but may miss information
    - **Medium K (3-5)**: Balanced quality and speed ✅
    - **High K (6+)**: Comprehensive but slow
    
    ### Key Factors:
    1. **Latency**: More docs = longer processing
    2. **Quality**: More docs = better coverage (up to a point)
    3. **Cost**: More docs = more tokens = higher cost
    4. **Relevance**: Too many docs can dilute context
    
    ## 💡 Key Takeaway:
    **K=3 is often optimal, but tune based on your specific needs!**
